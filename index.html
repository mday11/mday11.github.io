		<p> There are many interesting parts to this interactive website the MoMA has created. The interactive elements are configured in a circle 
		with the center being a silhouette of a child continually walking. This is both visually interesting and a good symbol for the passage of time. 
		The circle is arranged into sections with each section representing a time period. Each section is assigned its own color so you can 
		differentiate the time periods. There are several items spread through out each section and when you hover your cursor over an item, you 
		receive  the name of the item and the year it would have been used it. This makes it easy to decide what section you might be interested in
		 learning about. You can then click into a section a get an in depth timeline of that time period.
