		<h1> A Review of the MoMA's Interactive Website: Century of the Child</h1>
			<img src="images/momachildren.png" alt="Screenshot of the MoMA Century of the Child intertactive website">
		<h2><a href="http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2012/centuryofthechild/">MoMA Century of the Child</a></h2>
		<p> There are many interesting parts to this interactive website the MoMA has created. The interactive elements are configured in a circle 
		with the center being a silhouette of a child continually walking. This is both visually interesting and a good symbol for the passage of time. 
		The circle is arranged into sections with each section representing a time period. Each section is assigned its own color so you can 
		differentiate the time periods. There are several items spread through out each section and when you hover your cursor over an item, you 
		receive  the name of the item and the year it would have been used it. This makes it easy to decide what section you might be interested in
		 learning about. You can then click into a section a get an in depth timeline of that time period.

		<h2><a href="https://www.mnh.si.edu/vtp/1-desktop/"> Smithsonian NMNH Virtual Tour</a></h2>
		<p>   I find the ability to tour the museum with out being in the museum mind blowing. The almost 360 degree viewing is incredibly useful for
		 viewing the museum. There are little cameras on the throughout the tour and when clicked on, it pulls up detail photographs of objects that 
		 may be too small to see well on the virtual tour. This added element gives the viewer opportunity to see every portion of the museum's exhibits. 
		 In the top corner of the page, there is a drop down map for each floor. You can click on almost any exhibits and be taken to that portion of the 
		 museum.

		  <h1>Qwerty Beats Website</h1>

		keyboard">
		<h2><a href="http://www.unitunitunit.com/qwertybeats/"> Qwerty Beats Website</a></h2>
		<p>   This website seems so simple. The only thing on the page is a keyboard, but I have come to find you can spend much time just playing with this keyboard. 
		Each key makes a different sound. The grey keys make a continuous sound whereas the yellow keys make a sound once. This allows for you to make different beats.
